   may be prompted with an SSL/TLS security warning.  It is safe to bypass this

   NOTE:: check "Overwrite Existing Templates" if necessary

You should now see a template beginning with the name 'appsvcs_integration' at 
the top of the template list

.. NOTE::
    iApp templates are part of the BIG-IP config; as a result they will be 
    synchronized across BIG-IP clusters that have config synchronization enabled
